Some Questions you can answer with this data:
Unfortunately, this data set is not as wide as I was hoping. There are not too many interesting variables.
However, it would be interesting to use the data to examine BART payroll practices. If you could match/integrate with other datasets, it would be interesting to see:
1. What's the average salary increase by Job Family/ are there outliers?
2. How is salary correlated to # years working and other factors?
3. What % of budget goes to salary?
4. This is pretty far out there, but suppose we have an organizational chart. How does salary correlate to degrees of separation from executive managers?
